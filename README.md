# cpp-practice-projects
This repository contains a collection of beginner-to-intermediate C++ projects I created as part of my programming practice. Each project focuses on solving specific problems using C++ fundamentals, including input/output operations, control structures, and basic mathematical calculations.

Projects Included:

1. BSc Module GPA Calculator - Calculates the GPA based on module grades and credits.
2. Atwood's Machine Calculator - Computes tension and acceleration for Atwood's machine scenarios.
3. Fahrenheit to Celsius Converter - Converts temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius.
4. Test Score Calculator - Calculates the average and grades from a set of test scores.

These projects demonstrate my understanding of C++ programming concepts and problem-solving skills.
